  "My most worshipable golden Lord Gauranga is joyfully surrounded by His most loving devotees in Shrivasa Pandita's courtyard at night. There He immerses Himself in the transcendental ocean of congregationally chanting His own holy names (internally absorbed in the divine rasa-dance of Shri Shri Radha and Krishna). He also dances wildly in a state of tearful shivering and over-whelming jubilation. After singing and dancing to His heart's content, He goes to a quiet flower-garden and enjoys a feast of forest fruits, served to Him as He reclines upon a jeweled bedstead. Thus, the Son of Shachi Devi is most deserving of my whole-hearted selfless worship.",
  "My dear mind! Just worship Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu who, at the end of the night, suddenly awakens upon hearing the sweet warbling of the birds within the delightfully flowering forest grove of Shrivasa Pandit! At this time, His whole body is intensely thrilled due to His being aware of Lord Krishna being situated very close to Shrimati Radhrarani on Their flower-bed in a bower-house in Vrindavan. Because of this Lord Gauranga's ecstatic love is expressed instantly by wonderfully transcendental symptoms such a fountains of tears gushing from His eyes, which bathe His entire body. Just worship this Lord Gauranga, Whose bodily complexion can only be compared to shimmering pure molten gold.",
  "After sunrise, Lord Gauranga Mahaprabhu washes His moon-like face and comes out into the courtyard, where He sits and speaks lovingly from the heart with extreme eagerness and at great length to His most beloved devotees about Lord Kesava's morning pastimes at Nanda-gram. While speaking He tastes with great relish the ecstatic mood of Radharani, which causes His entire body to fully blossom in transcendental jubilation. Dear mind, just perform your worship with boundless, unending pure love for this golden Lord Gauranga.",
  "I worship the moon-like Shrila Gaurangachandra Who, among His closest devotees, remembers Krishnas forenoon pastimes of leaving for the forest to tend His cows. During this period, all the residents of Vraja come out and become greatly anxious due to Krishnas departure from their midst. Lord Gauranga is so absorbed in this intense remembrance that He virtually becomes fused with the Vraja pastimes. Thus He imitates their statements and actions, also bestowing their mood amongst His Navadvipa devotees, who are in reality alternate manifestations of those self-same residents of Vraja.",
  "Oh my dear mind! Continuously worship the Son of Mother Shachi Lord Gauranga! His whole body erupts in ecstatic bumps of sheer delight when He remembers the extensively variegated midday pastimes of Krishna sporting with Radha and the multitude of gopis. His voice stutters and chokes in excitement as He describes these lilas among His devotees, and thus He manifests the performance of plays and dramas which simultaneously correspond to the occurrence of the Divine Couple's pastimes.",
  "Lord Gauranga remembers the son of the King of Vraja, who returns from the pasture grounds in the noon, an event which produces an unlimited ocean of bliss for all the residents of Vraja. Remembering within the core of His heart, Lord Gauranga dances throughout the town of Navadvipa, spinning around while exhaling deeply ecstatic sighs. Thus becoming completely enchanted, He enchantes the townspeople so much that they all become helplessly stunned in divine love. Oh my dear mind, just worship this Shri Gauranga!",
  "Then Krishna takes His evening bath, has His dinner and performs many other fascinating pastimes around sunset time, then Lord Gauranga absorbs Himself in thinking of these pastimes again and again with great relish. In the circle of His own dearmost devotees, He constantly follows along those same wonderful pastimes. Dear mind! Just worship this moon-like Lord Gauranga-candra!",
  "In the evening, Shrimati Radharani travels to the pre-assigned pleasure-grove in the company of Her gopi-friends and waits impatiently for Krishna to arrive for Their secret rendezvous. When She receives news from a messenger about the activities and whereabouts of Her Beloved Lord Krishna, Her heart is completely overwhelmed with the most instense anxiety. Oh my! In exactly that same mood, Lord Gauranga travels to the courtyard of Shrivasa Pandita in the evening, walking hand on hip as Radha does. Afterwards, when He realizes that Shri Krishna has indeed arrived before Shri Radha, Lord Gauranga jubilantly dances and stumbles repeatedly, His body erupting in intense euphoria with torrents of tears and shivering limbs. Just worship the fair-complexioned Lord Gauranga!"

  "Continuing well into the night, Lord Gauranga dances and dances with Prabhu Nityananda in the courtyard of Shrivasa, surrounded by His most intimate devotees. His ecstatic singing is accompanied by the devotees who are expert in playing very loud rhytms on the mridanga drums. He wanders and dances with Shri Gadadhara Prabhu in the most astonishing way troughout the night, until just before dawn. Then He returns to His own home, where He retires to His bedchamber and falls asleep. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-nataraja.",
  "At the end of the night, upon hearing the pleasant sounds made by many birds such as cuckoos, roosters, and others, Lord Shri Gauranga arises from His bed. With His wife, Shri Vishnu-priya, He discusses many topics concerning the transcendental mellows of Their mutual loving affairs and thus They become very pleased. Then He gets up and goes to another room, wherein He sits upon a raised sitting place and is assisted by His devotees in washing His lotus face with nicely scented water. Thereafter, He very happily visits His mother, Shri Shachi Devi, as well as other friends and relatives in the home. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-sundara.",
  "In the morning, after sunrise, Lord Gauranga goes with His associates to bathe in the holy river. While bathing, they also worship Mother Ganga by offering flowers, incense and other presentations. They then come onto the bank of the river, where He is dressed with exquisite cloth and decorated with fresh flower garlands, sandalwood paste and other ornaments. Returning to His home in order to perform opulent worship of Lord Vishnu, as well as other rituals, they later partake of the foodstuffs that were offered to Lord Vishnu. After washing His hand and mouth, Lord Gauranga goes into another room and rests very happily for awhile. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-hari.",
  "Upon the arrival of the forenoon period, Lord Gauranga gets up from His nap and streches His body. Then He washes His lotus face with sweetly scented water. Meeting with His devotees, Who are all very fond of chanting Shri Gaurahari-nama-kirtana, He personally tastes and relishes the chanting of the holy names. Thus He sports, sometimes in the way, He increases the ecstatic pleasure of all the townspeople so much that it attains limitless heights. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga-chandra.",
  "During the midday period, Lord Gauranga continues to enjoy the performance of intensely enthusiastic chanting and dancing, surrounded by His own dear devotees such as the moon-like Advaita Acharya, Gadadhara Pandita, and the divine madman Shrila Nityananda Prabhu. Afterwards,they all wander throughout the gardens and groves on the bank of the Ganga, where they enjoy the sweet cooling breezes blowing over the river. Hearing the pleasant sounds of the bumblebees and the birds in those gardens, the Lord remembers His ecstatic pastimes as Radha and Krishna, which are occurring simultaneously in His own forest of Vrindavana. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Lord Gauranga.",
  "During the splendidly beautiful afternoon period, Lord Gauranga and His devotees all become equally maddened in ecstatic love, and thus they expand ever-increasing waves of auspicious benefit that ripple all through-out the three worlds. In this mood, they leave the gardens and travel back toward His home. Along the way, He satisfies the eyes of all the townspeople, just as the moon satisfies the chakora bird with its moonbeams. Reaching home, Lord Gauranga is met at the door by His mother and lavished with loving attentions. I meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.",
  "At dusk, the Lord bathes with His dear friends in the Ganga, the river who flows in the three parts. They devoutly worship the Ganga by offering ghee lamps, flowers, and other articles. Afterwards, the Lord puts on fresh silken clothes and is adorned with flower garlands. Then, He worships Lord Vishnu at home by performing the evening arati ceremony, offering ghee lamps and other items. Later, He and His friends partake of the foodstuffs and betel nuts that were offered to Lord Vishnu. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Shri Gauranga.",
  "In the evening time, Lord Gauranga goes to the home of Shrivasa Pandita, accompanied by Shrila Advaitachandra and other dear associates. Meeting with the multitude of His devotees, He tastes and relishes the nectar of topics about Lord Hari, and His mind becomes most agitated with the ecstasies of pure love of Godhead. Then, becoming very lustful to relish the congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Lord Gauranga orchestrates the performance of intensely jubilant sankirtana, which attains the summit of passionate glorification ,of these holy names. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Lord Gauranga-sundara."
